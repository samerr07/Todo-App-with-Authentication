# Todo App with Authentication

This is a simple Todo application built with React.js that includes user authentication and uses local storage to store user data. Users can create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
- **Todo Operations:** Users can create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Local Storage:** User data and tasks are stored in the local storage for persistence.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router:** Declarative routing for React.js applications.
- **Local Storage:** For storing user data and tasks locally.
- **CSS:** Styling the components and layout.

## Usage

### 1. Sign Up
- Create a new account by providing your name and password.

### 2. Log In
 - Log into your account with your registered name and password.

### 3. Add Task
Add new tasks to your todo list:
- Enter the task description in the input field.
- Click "Add Task" to add the task to your list.

### 4. Update Task
- Click on a task to edit its description.

### 5. Complete Task
- Mark a task as completed:


### 6. Delete Task
Remove a task from your list:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
